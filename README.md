# jsDCPU16
JavaScript implementation of the virtual DCPU-16 for the game 0x10c


## Demo

You can play around with this emulator at
http://bivouac.kiessling.net/jsDCPU16

All registers and opcodes, including JSR, are implemented, but expect
smaller glitches.

I haven't written an assembler (yet), you can find the hex codes of
several programs at http://www.dcpubin.com/

The DCPU-16 specification is at http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt
